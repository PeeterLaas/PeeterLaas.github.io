## COVID-19 Wastewater Surveillance (2020–2023)
I played a lead role in establishing the **nationwide SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring system** in Estonia. [cite_start]This project provided early warning surveillance data to the government and was nominated for "Tartu Deed of the Year"[cite: 26, 60].

* [cite_start]**Key Outcome:** Developed tools to sequence SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater samples[cite: 58].
* [cite_start]**Funding:** Supported by the Ministry of Education and Research (~1.1M EUR)[cite: 61].

## Baltic Sea Ecosystems
My earlier research focused on the spatiotemporal dynamics of bacterioplankton in the Baltic Sea, specifically regarding:
* [cite_start]**Hypoxia:** How near-bottom oxygen depletion impacts bacterial communities[cite: 173].
* [cite_start]**Stratification:** Multi-scale physical processes controlling biogeochemical signals[cite: 79].
