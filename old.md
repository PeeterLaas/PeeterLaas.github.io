I am a **Research Fellow in Molecular Ecology** at the [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee) and a Research Fellow at the **FinEst Centre for Smart Cities** (Tallinn University of Technology).

My research focuses on **environmental microbiology** and **molecular ecology**, with a specific interest in how microbial communities interact with their environments—from the Baltic Sea to urban wastewater systems.

### 🏆 Research Highlights



My research journey spans diverse fields, with a strong focus on **environmental microbiology** and **molecular ecology**. I am particularly interested in how microbial communities interact with their environments, from vast marine systems like the Baltic Sea to critical urban infrastructure such as wastewater treatment plants.



Key areas of my work include:



*   **Genetic Engineering:** Serving as a national expert on GMOs and a member of the Estonian Gene Technology Committee.

*   **Molecular Diagnostics:** Developing and implementing wastewater-based surveillance systems for SARS-CoV-2 (recognized with the University of Tartu Contribution to Society Award 2021 and Tartu Deed of the Year nominee 2021), conducting research on complex biofilms, antimicrobial resistance transmission in a 'One Health' context, and genomic microbial source tracking for bathing water quality assessment.

*   **Microbial Ecology:** Investigating spatiotemporal dynamics of bacterioplankton communities in various ecosystems, including the anoxic "dead zones" of the Baltic Sea, the Florida Coastal Everglades, and the Keys Archipelago.

*   **Genetic Diagnostics of Fecal Contamination:** Currently, my main research focus is on this area for Bathing Water Quality assessment.

### 🔬 Research Focus



**Urban & Environmental Microbiology**

Currently, I am working on the **UrbanSplash pilot project** as part of the FinEst Centre for Smart Cities (2024–2027). We are developing smart city solutions to monitor and manage urban water environments effectively.



**Microplastics & Biofilms**

I am also investigating the **impact of marine microplastic-associated biofilms** on environmental and human health (2021–2026). This project explores how "plastispheres" act as vectors for microbial colonization in marine systems.

### 💻 Expertise & Technical Skills



I possess strong bioinformatics and technical skills, honed through sysadmin roles and international collaborations:



*   **Bioinformatics:** R programming, Nextflow, Singularity, Docker, CONDA-based pipelines and solutions.

*   **System Administration:** Experience with Linux servers, cloud service-based environments, and HPC clusters.

*   **International Collaboration:** Worked in international work groups in the USA, Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, and collaborated closely with colleagues in the UK, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.
