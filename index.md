I am a **Research Fellow in Molecular Ecology** at the [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee) and a Research Fellow at the **FinEst Centre for Smart Cities** (Tallinn University of Technology).

My research focuses on **environmental microbiology** and **molecular ecology**, with a specific interest in how microbial communities interact with their environments—from the Baltic Sea to urban wastewater systems.

### 🏆 Research Highlights

My work in establishing the nationwide **SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring system** was recognized with:
* **The University of Tartu Contribution to Society Award** (2021)
* **Tartu Deed of the Year** nominee (2021) for the "essential initiative for the whole of Estonia."

### 🔬 Current Research Focus

**Urban & Environmental Microbiology**
Currently, I am working on the **UrbanSplash pilot project** as part of the FinEst Centre for Smart Cities (2024–2027). We are developing smart city solutions to monitor and manage urban water environments effectively.

**Microplastics & Biofilms**
I am also investigating the **impact of marine microplastic-associated biofilms** on environmental and human health (2021–2026). This project explores how "plastispheres" act as vectors for microbial colonization in marine systems.
